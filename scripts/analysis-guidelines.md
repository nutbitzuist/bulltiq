# AI Analysis Content Guidelines

These guidelines define the standards for AI-generated financial analyses for stocks and ETFs in the Bulltiq platform.

## 1. Length and Depth
- **Target Length**: 3,000 - 4,000 Thai words per analysis.
- **Character Count**: Approximately 10,000 - 15,000 characters.
- **Requirement**: Content must be comprehensive, providing deep insights rather than just surface-level facts.

## 2. Formatting Standards
- **Markdown**: **DO NOT** use any markdown bolding (`**text**`).
- **Structure**: Use clear headings (`##`) and bullet points for readability.
- **Lists**: Use standard markdown lists.

## 3. Style and Tone
- **Voice**: Professional, neutral, and expert-level financial advisor.
- **Language**: Thai (Formal/Semi-formal).
- **Objectivity**: Maintain an objective view, discussing both risks and opportunities.

## 4. Standard Sections
Each analysis should ideally include:
1.  **Overview**: What the company/ETF does.
2.  **Business Model / Portfolio Strategy**: Detailed breakdown of how they make money or their investment logic.
3.  **Financial Performance / Historical Trends**: Analysis of recent results.
4.  **Competitive Advantage (Moat) / Market Position**: Comparison with peers.
5.  **Risks & Challenges**: External and internal factors that could impact performance.
6.  **Investment Outlook**: Summary of the long-term potential.

## 5. Prohibited Elements
- No redundant phrases like "In conclusion" or "To summarize" if they add no value.
- No conversational filler (e.g., "I will now explain...").
- No placeholders (e.g., "[Insert data here]").
